## How to play

Move around with your hero to crush your enemies! The game consists of ten pre-made levels. On each level, you have to defeat the boss, and obtain a key, which is in the possesion of a randomly chosen lower level enemy.
In case you're defeated, don't worry! You can restart the game from the same level.
For every second move you make, your enemies will take a step in a random direction as well.
Be careful with the lava tiles!
